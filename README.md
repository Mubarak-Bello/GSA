##CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

## Key Takeaways

- Potential for Expansion: Right now, each state is fully invested in just one department. This creates a great opportunity to spread the investment and expand other departments into new regions.
- Revenue Influx: New York stands out, contributing a solid 30.77% of the total revenue. This highlights a prime opportunity to focus on this region for even further growth.
Payment Method Preferences: Transfer payments are the most popular and profitable choice, while Card payments are a bit underused—there’s definitely room to optimise and encourage more card transactions.
- Client Focus: Big players like Citigroup and Dell Technologies are driving much of the revenue. There's a real opportunity to build on these relationships and create more tailored offerings to help both the company and clients grow.
